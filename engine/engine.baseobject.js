/**
 * @class The base object class which represents an object within
 * the engine.  All objects should extend from this class mainly due to
 * the fact that the object intelligently will inherit a <tt>destroy</tt>
 * method.  This method gives the object an opportunity to clean up
 * object references, thus keeping the memory requirements low.
 * <p/>
 * This object also enhances the event handling provided by the {@link EventEngine}.
 * It will remember events assigned to the object so that they can be automatically
 * cleaned up when the object is destroyed.
 * <p/>
 * If you are working with an object that represents an HTML element (node),
 * this object is ideal to extend from.  It has methods for assigning and
 * accessing that element.
 * <p/>
 * The {@link #update} method is where the action occurs.  This method is
 * called each time a frame is generated by the engine to update the object.
 * In this method, you'll be able to update the components and perform
 * housekeeping.
 * 
 * @param name {String} The name of the object
 * @extends PooledObject
 * @constructor
 * @description Create a base object.
