============

To run with wiimote support, you need Linux/OS X and bluetooth headers that are close to, or exactly bluez headers.

$ git clone git@github.com:tbranyen/nodewii.git
$ cd nodewii
$ make update

<MAC_ADDR> is in format 00:AA:BB:CC:DD:EE
$ node wiimote-server.js <MAC_ADDR>

Example:
$ node wiimote-server.js 00:12:3A:F3:99:CC

Press buttons 1 & 2 to sync with the server.

Then run the game and use the buttons as follows:

Directionals are the same,
B is trigger
A is change weapon
1 is bomb
